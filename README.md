## Quick start

	> git clone https://github.com/jamesrenfro/poochable.git
	> virtualenv poochable
	> cd poochable
	> source bin/activate
	> pip install -r requirements
	> cp poochable/local_settings.template poochable/local_settings.py
	> edit local_settings.py as necessary, including AWS credentials, etc.
	> python manage.py syncdb
	> python manage.py runserver  

## Configuring to use S3 and CloudFront to store and distribute images

	In local_settings.py, in addition to setting up your database connection
	parameters, you can also provide AWS credentials. If you don't already have
	an existing S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution for this purpose, you'll
	need to log in to the AWS Management console [https://console.aws.amazon.com]
	and create one of each.
